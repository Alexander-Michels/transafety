# Transafety
In the future this smartphone application aims to make public transport a safer place. This is the first prototype build as a webpage.
It contains the two key elements of Transafety: A page where you are able to call for help (Emergency page) and a page where you can file a report (report page) to fill out after an incident. It will be send automatically to the appropriate authorities once you submit it. 
Additionally you can find a Landing page and a thank you page.

## Installation

## Contributing
We appreciate your feedback and suggestions.

## Status
Please note that this is the first prototype and built to give a first insight and in order to appreciate the potential benefit of the application.

## How it will work
When you open the website/ app you start on the landing page.
By clicking on the emergency button you will be taken to the emergency page. There you have the option to either sound an alarm or report the incident.
You will the be taken to the report page and where you can fill in details of the incident and your contact details if you wish. If you agree to the privacy policy your report will be submitted to the appropriate authority and you will land on the thank you page.
In future we want to make this into an app to make more functions available, like a hotspot map of incidents with exact times and locations for example.
